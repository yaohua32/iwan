# IWAN

## A brief introduction to IWAN
IWAN is a deep learning-based approach to numericaly solve a class of inverse problems, including electrical impedance tomography(EIT) and dynamic electrical impedance tomography(dynamic EIT) problems. IWAN bases on the [Weak Adversarial Netwok(WAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08272) which was proposed for solving high dimensional partial differential equations(PDEs). IWAN is completely mesh-free and particularly suitable for problems with high dimensionality and low regularity on solutions.

## About the code
* This code was written by 'python 3.6' and [Tensorflow1](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
* One should keep it in mind that the parameters provided in the code may not efficiently work for different types of problems. So one may need readjust the parameters when use the code for solving different problems.
